# Module 4 Challenge - Code Quiz

## Description

This application is my solution to the Module 4 Challenge of the Coding Bootcamp.
This application allows users to play a quiz with coding-based questions. Users receive a score at the end of the game and can view top scores of previous playthroughs;
